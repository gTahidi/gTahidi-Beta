## Commit Process

When committing changes to the repository, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Commit Message Format**: Use a concise and descriptive commit message that summarizes the purpose of your changes. Start with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update") followed by a brief description of the change. Example: `Add new feature for user authentication`.

2. **Commit Scope**: Provide a clear scope or context for your commits, indicating the affected component, module, or feature. This helps maintain clarity and organization in the commit history.

3. **Commit Size**: Keep commits small and focused. Break down larger changes into smaller, atomic commits that address specific issues or tasks. This makes it easier to review and understand individual changes.

4. **Referencing Issues**: If your commit addresses a specific issue or pull request, reference it in your commit message using the appropriate keywords (e.g., "Fixes", "Resolves", "Closes"). Example: `Fix typo in README.md (Fixes #123)`.

5. **Documentation Updates**: Ensure that your commits include any necessary updates to documentation to reflect your changes. This helps maintain consistency between code changes and accompanying documentation.

6. **Code Review Requirements**: Before pushing your commits, ensure that they meet the project's code review requirements. This may include obtaining a certain number of approvals from reviewers and addressing any feedback received during the review process.

7. **Testing**: Whenever possible, include tests for your changes to verify their correctness and ensure that they do not introduce regressions. Run existing tests to ensure they pass before committing your changes.

8. **Atomic Commits**: Aim for atomic commits that represent a single logical change. Avoid mixing unrelated changes in a single commit, as this can make it harder to review and revert changes if needed.


By following these guidelines, you can contribute to a clean and well-organized commit history, making it easier for maintainers and other contributors to understand and collaborate on the project.
