## Scope of Contributions

We welcome all contributions that align with our company's goals. This includes, but is not limited to, code enhancements, bug fixes, documentation improvements, and feature additions.

This document contains rules that govern the Ujao's contribution process and operations. It serves as a standard guiding point for every contributor.

Feel free to make inquiries and explore the suggestions put forward as our policies. At Ujao, we value feedback and inclusivity! Reach out to us at [info@ujaotech.com](mailto:info@ujaotech.com).

## Contribution Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository you wish to contribute to.

2. **Branch**: To contribute, please work on the `prod1` branch of this repository. Ensure that you fork this repository and create a new branch for your contribution within your forked repository.

3. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes in your feature branch. Ensure that your code follows our coding standards and architecture guidelines.

4. **Write Tests**: Add unit tests to cover your changes and ensure that all existing tests pass.

5. **Document Your Changes**: Update the documentation to reflect your changes. Provide clear explanations of your approach and the functionalities implemented.

6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your changes are complete, submit a pull request to the main repository. Provide a clear description of your changes and the purpose of your contribution.

### Preferred Code Formatting: Markdown

We prefer the use of Markdown for formatting code. Markdown provides a simple and easy-to-read syntax for formatting text, making it well-suited for documenting code snippets, README files, and other project documentation. Additionally, using Markdown ensures consistency and readability across our repositories.

## Version Control Best Practices

Use branches effectively to isolate changes and facilitate collaboration.

## Testing Guidelines

All code contributions must include appropriate unit tests to verify functionality and prevent regressions.
Run tests locally before submitting a pull request to ensure that your changes don't introduce failures.

## Review Process

Pull requests are reviewed on a weekly basis by Daniel Omusula and Brian Kechy. Feedback and suggestions will be provided during the review process to help improve the quality of contributions.

## Communication

For questions, discussions, or collaboration, please use our designated communication channels, such as Slack channels, email lists, or GitHub discussions.

If you have feedback or concerns about the project or the contribution process, please [contact us](mailto:info@ujaotech.com) or [open an issue](link-to-issue-tracker) on GitHub.
