# gTahidi Beta

This is the Public beta version of gTahidi AI, a partly open-source version of the live application. This project represents an attempt to integrate Artificial Intelligence into live learning in African classrooms. With the emergence of Generative AI, one cannot help but think about what this technology can do to achieve effective, equitable, and efficient education (SDG4) for the African continent.

## Current Capabilities

The application allows for the creation and free access to teaching materials such as lesson plans, lesson notes, and quizzes. More capabilities will be added based on user requests and also according to studied user behavior.

## Funding of gTahidi AI

The project is sponsored by Microsoft, through the [Microsoft For Startups Program](https://foundershub.startups.microsoft.com/). A big thank you to all sponsors of the project and all volunteers.
